# Simplifi CSV Formatter for Canadians



Utility for the budgeting app [Simplifi](https://www.quicken.com/products/simplifi/) intended for those that prefer manually importing csv files from their banks.


Simplify requires transaction imports be in a specific format.

|Date     |Payee    |Amount |Tags            |
|---------|---------|-------|----------------|
|3/13/2020|Starbucks|-7     |Vacation        |
|3/15/2020|Uber     |-21.12 |Hawaii, Vacation|
|3/17/2020|Acme     |1735.21|                |

<br><br>
Canadian Banks are all over the place with the format of their transaction CSV exporting.
<br><br>

Availablility of downloading transactions to CSV varies between financial institutions (Some allow 2 months, others Years). 
<br><br>
I will update the following table over time.
