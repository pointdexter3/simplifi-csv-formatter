# Bugs
- cannot handle transactions that are 0 (not sure if a transaction being zero is valid, tangerine specific)

# Future Enhancements


## Minor




## Major

Auto scan column format ** might not be worth the effort given how easy it is to add institutions / make minor tweaks to logic **
- scan header to determine amounts / credit amount / debit amount / posted date / transaction date 
- if not, or scanned header doesn't pass test, scan individual columns using regex to determine columns
- if multiple date columns, keep the later one (posted date)
- if separate Debit and Credit columns, figure out which is which, invert amount, combine (RBC/TD)
- Determine when amounts should be inverted(?) (BMO-CC)
