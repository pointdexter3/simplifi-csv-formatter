Download and save any CSV's you would like combined in this folder (naming not important)

In addition to searching for your-filename.csv, The fi-formatter script will also search for a directory of the same name (not including the .csv extension) 
/your-filename

If no files are found to combine in the /your-filename directory the your-filename.csv file will be used.
